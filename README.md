- How your website accomplished each item in the criteria.

1. Application of Concepts Taught:

My HTML structure is well-organized, with with appropriate use of semantic tags like "<section>, <nav>, and <ul>". I also used external CSS styles and have applied transitions effectively. The use of flexbox and grid in CSS demonstrates an understanding of layout techniques. However, I didn't apply responsiveness to my website because it's so hard to figure out.


2. Design:

The design appears clean and more minimalist. The use of a background image and profile picture in the profile section adds a visually appealing. The hover effects on the navigation and profile pictures create a dynamic feel. In addition, the color scheme is consistent and visually pleasing.



3. Content:

It is well-organized and only necessary information, with clear sections for personal background, skills, and projects. I think my information is concise and easy to read.

The website demonstrates creativity through the use of hover effects, animation in the typing effect for your name, and the overall layout. The skills and projects section's bouncing animation adds a playful element.
